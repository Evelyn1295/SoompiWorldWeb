## <a name="project"></a>My Project

My main motivation to do this project was based on something I like, which is Korean culture.

Thanks to globalization, especially the last film success that was "Parasites" and the expansion of kpop. 
Many people are interested in knowing a little bit about this culture.


The main way to know the culture nowadays is through movies, series and k-pop.

With this theme, is what I have based on for its development.


Using what I have learned in the course, I have tried to do my best.

Although I know that there is still a lot to improve, I will continue to improve it over time.


Thank you for everything you have taught me. You have opened up a path for me to continue learning.

Thank you very much!
